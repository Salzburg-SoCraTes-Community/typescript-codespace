**Fork the Repository**
* Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
* Click the [Fork button](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) (top-right) to create a copy in your account.

**Go to Your Fork**
* Open your forked repository in GitHub.

**On your forked repository page, click the green Code button.**
* Select the Codespaces tab.
* [Create a New Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/quickstart)
* Click "Create codespace on main" (or your desired branch).

**The Codespace will automatically set up the development environment.**
* Once the Codespace is ready, start coding directly in your browser or VS Code.
